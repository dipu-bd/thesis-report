Automated license plate recognition is important in many contexts like- security and law enforcement, monitoring vehicles, automated parking control. To enable these automated services in Bangladesh we are proposing an efficient method in this paper. The task of recognizing vehicle number plate consists of three stage: plate detection, character segmentation and character recognition. We reviewed several methods for each stage, and choose the best one. The main objective of this research is to gain high accuracy in an efficient manner, keeping into consideration the facts of lighting conditions, vehicle motion, noisy plates, segmented words. Our primary target is to recognize the standard bangla license plates. But we also tested our methods on non-standard license plates.
%
For standard license plate we have gained {\bf XX\%} accuracy in plate detection, {\bf XX\%} in character segmentation and {\bf XX\%} in recognition, resulting in {\bf XX\%} accuracy overall.
