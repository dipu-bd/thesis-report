\subsection{Particular Pathogen Detection}
MinION\cite{minion} sequencing has an application that has gained tremendous interest in the researcher community, that is the identification of pathogens\cite{GraphMap} in clinical samples. Due to sequencing
errors and choice of read, mapper could significantly bias results in such cases and lead to misleading outcome or false analysis.
\par 
So an accurate and highly specific mapper is mostly needed for such cases. With long reads having a higher error rate than general makes the task more challenging. So a mapper for long read sequences with an accurate results will make such analysis and identification more fruitful and effective.
