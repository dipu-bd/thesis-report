We have poor overall accuracy and performance comparing to the other paper. Main reason behind this is that our dataset were not large enough and image quality is too poor. Due to testing purposes we separated each step as stages. The overhead cost of compiling each module and executing separately had a huge effect on the efficiency of our system.
