\section{Feature Analysis}

For detecting the license plate, feature analysis must be done after an image is preprocessed properly.
Checking the edges for detecting any rectangle shaped area is the most common technique for feature analysis.
To detect the plate boundary, some researchers use horizontal lines and others look for vertical lines.
Edge detection is commonly done with Canny (Kong, Liu, Lu, and Zhou-2005) \cite{Kong2005}  and Sobel edge detection (Jiao, Ye, and Huang 2009 \cite{jiao_ye_huang_2009}).
As foe some exception some researches do not use edge detection, but try to find high contrast area (Huang, Chang, Chen, and Sandnes-2008) \cite{HUANG2008}. The theory behind this technique is - plates generally have higher contrast area than other parts of the image.
