\section{Literature Review}
The first task was to find the problem domain to work on. The next task was to make literature reviews for our work plan and also for ensuring that we are not doing something again or worse. We've found few papers related to ALPR for Bengali languages and many more in different languages. Finally, we did select 24 papers to read and review for our thesis work. We've written 7 review papers those seemed close to our topic. From those papers and reviews we've managed to find and understand our particular domain of work which will be described in the later parts.

\section{Summary}
Review of previous works shows that the edge detection approach can be used effectively to find the license plate region. Geometrical feature analysis is an appropriate approach for this. Some researches used their own recogntion system, others used OCR engines like - teserract. Some parts of all these research can be used further in this work, others are of no use for future work.
