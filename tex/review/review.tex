The first task was to find the problem domain to work on. The next task was to make literature reviews for our work plan and also for ensuring that we are not doing something again or worse. We've found few papers related to ALPR for Bengali languages and many more in different languages. Finally, we did select 24 papers to read and review for our thesis work. We've written 7 review papers those seemed close to our topic. From those papers and reviews we've managed to find and understand our particular domain of work which will be described in the later parts.
