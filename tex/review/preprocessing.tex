\section{Preprocessing}

Preprocessing techniques are used to get a better performance in the next sections. This is one of the key task after image acquisition. It ensures good data input for the main parts of the license plate detection and recognition system.

Most common approach is done in two steps. The image is converted to a gray scale image format to the next steps (Waterhouse-2006) \cite{waterhouse-2006}. Then, any additional noise is reduced from the image with different types of algorithms in different cases. Most common techniques for reducing noise from input image are the Median filter(Songke and Yixian-2011) \cite{songke-yixian}
and Gaussian filter(Sedighi and Vafadust 2011) \cite{sedighi-vafadust}. Contrast enhancement is an additional technique followed by many researchers(Abolghasemi and Ahmadyfard - 2009) \cite{Abolghasemi2009} in this pre-processing part.
