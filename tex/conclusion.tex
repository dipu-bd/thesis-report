The remarkable notes are briefed below. Another section describe how the tool could be made more useful for the world and could be served in greater extent.
\section{Discussion}
NanoBASTer\cite{nanoBLAST} of Mohammad Ruhul Amin, BWA\cite{BWA_short} and BWA-SW\cite{BWA_long} of Heng Li, Bowtie\cite{bowtie} and Bowtie2\cite{bowtie2} of Ben Langmead are good alignment tools. But none of them could be selected and announced as the best to use in general. Minimap\cite{minimap} of Heng Li also a recent tool which is developed for mainly assembly tool like miniasm\cite{minimap} of him. From their work, we learnt a lot of thing. Before this, the concept of Minimizer\cite{KMC2,KMC}, Bloom filter\cite{BFCounter,turtle}, Hash Table\cite{corman,jellyfish}, Count-min Sketch\cite{minsketch}, Locality Sensitive Hashing\cite{LSH} etc. helped us a lot to think from different perspective.
