\section{Implementation}
We implemented our solution using {\it Python-3.x} using the {\it OpenCV-3} and {\it Numpy} libraries from Anaconda repository. 
The {\it OpenCV} library provides an extensive collection of image processing functions and techniques which proved very helpful in our implementation. 
{\it Numpy} has been used the most to manipulating 2D arrays, and in our design of Multilayer Perceptron model for recognizing characters.

For testing and analysis we used a separate implementation. In this implementation, we divided entire tasks into sequence of {\bf stages}. This {\it stages} act like individual modules. For example, a stage for Gaussian filter will only apply Gaussian filter to a set of input image and save the output to another folder to make it useful as input for later stages. This approach on testing proved to be quite useful and saved a lot of time during our research.
