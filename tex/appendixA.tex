	\section{Data Sources}
	There we used mainly two data sets for reference and three data set for read. Among them, one synthetic reference data set and one read data set is generated by us randomly. Our generated data set for read contains fifty read sequences having length ten thousands each. Our reference is treated as \emph{Synthetic Reference} and reads are treated as \emph{Synthetic Reads} in the context.
	
	As a real data, we have taken \emph{GenBank: U00096.1} version of \emph{Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 complete genome}\cite{ecoli_ref} which is freely available online.
	We have two read data sets for this reference genome. One is simulated by Ruhul Amin Shajib while developing NanoBLASTer \cite{nanoBLAST}. We called it \emph{20K Simulated Reads} or simply \emph{20K Reads} during the whole work and writings. The other data is treated as 25K reads which is collected from a source of data used in Minimap\cite{minimap}. The table \ref{tab:dataStat} shows a general statistics about the data sets.

	\section{Error Rate in Data}
	\emph{20K Simulated Reads} data has some \emph{unaligned} reads which we totally ignored in experiment. This data set has 15\% to 45\% error in data. \emph{20K Reads} data has up to 15\% error.
	On the other hand, our \emph{Synthetic Reads} data has no error as we randomly picked a chunk of 10K base at a time. However, we have added a limited number of random errors which have described in the corresponding context.
